    <h1>Cancelling the Social Network <small>October 31, 2015</small></h1>
    <p>
      We have decided here at podium that it is much too difficult to thrive in
      the social network market.
      There are too many major players, like Twitter and Facebook, that it is
      way too difficult to get big in the industry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Podium's main site, <a href="http://pdum.xyz">pdum.xyz</a>, which used to
      be the location of our social network, will be replaced with our primary
      company website.
      If you were excited for podium and want to use something similar to what
      we had planned, check out <a href="http://tumblr.com">tumblr</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our company will remain in operation, and will still be a subsidiary of
      <a href="http://vkhsoft.cu.cc">VKHSoft</a>, but will be focusing on projects
      other than our social network.
    </p>

      Sincerely,
